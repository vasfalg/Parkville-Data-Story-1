          <h2>Introduction</h2>

          <p>Walking through Parkville today, you might be drawn to Parkville Market, Connecticut’s first food hall, with a variety of scents and flavors from cuisines around the world. Or you might notice Gather55, a pay-what-you-can restaurant serving up meals prepared by professional chefs.  Or maybe your attention will be caught by the Curioporium, a museum-esque store full of oddities and legends.  But what you might not know about these businesses, unless you have lived in Hartford for a while, is that all of them are less than a decade old. </p>
            <p> In the past 20 years or so, Hartford's Parkville neighborhood has seen significant change.  I sat down with Clark University Master's student Zoe Chatfield to further discuss the change that is happening in Parkville.  Her thesis is on how Hartford’s housing has shaped Parkville.  We wondered, who is behind this change? What are their intentions? To answer these questions in a meaningful way, I decided to create a data story with original visualizations that would supplement Zoe's thesis. The broad goal of this data story is to answer these questions: Where are different types of housing located in Parkville? Who influences development in Parkville? and, more importantly, What are their visions and goals for this neighborhood? Are these visions and goals being met? </p>

          <h2>Who Owns Residential Property in Parkville?</h2>
          <p>The following table shows the top residential property owners in Parkville, sorted by the total appraised value of all properties owned.  Something interesting to note is that Dorothy Apartments LLC owns the most in property value and owns the most number of living units, but does not own the largest number of parcels. </p>

          <h2>How Has Parkville's Residential Property Changed?</h2>
          <p>The following table shows the total number of properties in the Parkville neighborhood that have changed since 2003. There are roughly 1000 total parcels of land in the Parkville neighborhood, and of these only 89 have changed in the past 20 years.  The most common change in Parkville was non-residential structures becoming a different type of non-residential structure. These non-residential changes will be discussed further below, in the "Developments" section.</p>
            <p>Another significant change was that 5 non-residential parcels became mixed use buildings.  The total number of living units added by this change alone is 19. However, the total number of living units in Parkville added since 2003 is only 7, because other parcel changes have reduced the number of living units.  So while the types of housing available in Parkville may be significantly different than they were 20 years ago, the total number of housing units has not changed much.</p>

         <h2>Methods</h2>
          <p>In order to create these visualizations, I used data from the Hartford Assessor's Office, which I was able to obtain through Zoe.  This dataset, which can be found in <a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Isz-M1LfoqIUDHmBmtT9goNXuF0LMRWq/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=114760113235497940492&rtpof=true&sd=true'>this Google sheet</a>, contained many variables that I knew I would not need for this project, so I started cleaning up the data by copying the datasets to new sheets and removing the columns I did not need.  I knew that if I made a mistake and accidentally deleted a column that I did need, I did not have to worry, because I was only modifying the copies of the data, and anything I needed from the original data I could easily find. </p>
          <p>After cleaning up the assessor's data, I downloaded a GEOJSON file of all of the land parcels in Hartford, and trimmed it to just the Parkville neighborhood using Mapshaper.  I then converted this GEOJSON file back to a CSV, so that I could modify it more easily. I then used a variety of formulas to match the Parkville parcel data with the data from the assessor's office.  Conveniently, each parcel has a GIS Pin, which was also present in the Assessor's dataset, so using VLOOKUP I was able to match each parcel with the attributes I desired.</p>
          <p>When matching the data, I came across the issue of some GIS Pins not being matched to those in the Assessor's data.  I was able to find most of the missing parcel data by reaching back out to the Assessor's Office and sending a list of the parcels I needed.  I then manually coded the remaining missing parcels, through matching their location on my map to their location on Google Maps, finding the address, and looking up that address to find out what type of sttructure, if any, was present. </p>

    <p>A big thank you to Professor Jack Dougherty in the Educational Studies department at Trinity College for his book Hands On Data Visualization, which was my primary reference for this study and immensely helpful.  I'd also like to thank him for meeting with me throughout the course to answer any and all of my questions. </p> 
          <p> Thank you also to Clark University Graduate Student Zoe Chatfield, who was my partner for this project. </p>
