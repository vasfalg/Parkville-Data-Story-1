          <h2>Introduction</h2>

          <p>This independent study is in collaboration with Clark University Master's student Zoe Chatfield.  The purpose of this study is to create visually appealing, easy to understand maps which will help community developers and neighborhood residents in the future.  The primary focus of this study was to examine residential property in Parkville, specifically, looking at who owns residential property, determining where different types of residential property are located, and evaluating how Parkville's residential property has changed in the past 20 years. </p>
          <p class="lead">The Importance of Mapping</p>
          <p> Maps are useful to people in a variety of professions for several reasons. They help us visualize data with a spatial component, and in doing so enables planners and community developers to do things like assess the needs of a neighborhood or city, determine optimal transportation routes, and develop other basic infrastructure. </p>
          <p> A good map is difficult to create, but should be easy to read. Maps are much more complex visualizations than charts and tables, and the more complex a visualization, the more decisions must be made. Cartographers must determine what size scale to use, how large or small symbols and lines should be, and which colors best represent the data, among many other things that go into making a map.  </p>

          <h2>How Has Parkville Changed?</h2>
          <p>The following table shows the total number of properties in the Parkville neighborhood that have changed since 2003. </p>
         <iframe src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQOhW8RDM0_podtqaIcgQ7hnZkF5k0KNargMUpAmBI1ZvlDbgclyGHNSezETOfa180oRrFHXOkZj0I2/pubhtml?gid=2024412925&amp;single=true&amp;widget=true&amp;headers=false"width="100%" height="400" scrolling="no"></iframe>
          <p>There are roughly 1000 total parcels of land in the Parkville neighborhood, and of these only 89 have changed in the past 20 years.  The most common change in Parkville was non-residential structures becoming a different type of non-residential structure. Another significant change was that 5 non-residential parcels became mixed use buildings.  The total number of living units added by this change alone is 19. However, the total number of living units in Parkville added since 2003 is only 7, because other parcel changes have reduced the number of living units.  So while the types of housing available in Parkville may be significantly different than they were 20 years ago, the total number of housing units is roughly the same. </p>

          <p> Explore the following map to see where in Parkville these changes have occurred. </p>

          <h2>Methods</h2>
          <p>In order to create these visualizations, I used data from the Hartford Assessor's Office, which I was able to obtain through Zoe.  This dataset, which can be found in <a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Isz-M1LfoqIUDHmBmtT9goNXuF0LMRWq/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=114760113235497940492&rtpof=true&sd=true'>this Google sheet</a>, contained many variables that I knew I would not need for this project, so I started cleaning up the data by copying the datasets to new sheets and removing the columns I did not need.  I knew that if I made a mistake and accidentally deleted a column that I did need, I did not have to worry, because I was only modifying the copies of the data, and anything I needed from the original data I could easily find. </p>
          <p>After cleaning up the assessor's data, I downloaded a GEOJSON file of all of the land parcels in Hartford, and trimmed it to just the Parkville neighborhood using Mapshaper.  I then converted this GEOJSON file back to a CSV, so that I could modify it more easily. I then used a variety of formulas to match the Parkville parcel data with the data from the assessor's office.  Conveniently, each parcel has a GIS Pin, which was also present in the Assessor's dataset, so using VLOOKUP I was able to match each parcel with the attributes I desired.</p>
          <p>When matching the data, I came across the issue of some GIS Pins not being matched to those in the Assessor's data.  I was able to find most of the missing parcel data by reaching back out to the Assessor's Office and sending a list of the parcels I needed.  I then manually coded the remaining missing parcels, through matching their location on my map to their location on Google Maps, finding the address, and looking up that address to find out what type of sttructure, if any, was present. </p>

        <p>A big thank you to Professor Jack Dougherty in the Educational Studies department at Trinity College for his book Hands On Data Visualization, which was my primary reference for this study and immensely helpful.  I'd also like to thank him for meeting with me throughout the course to answer any and all of my questions. </p> 
          <p> Thank you also to Clark University Graduate Student Zoe Chatfield, who was my partner for this project. </p>
