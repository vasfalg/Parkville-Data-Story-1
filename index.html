          <h2>Introduction</h2>

          <p>This independent study is in collaboration with Clark University Master's student Zoe Chatfield.  The purpose of this study is to create visually appealing, easy to understand maps which will help community developers and neighborhood residents in the future.  The primary focus of this study was to examine residential property in Parkville, specifically, looking at who owns residential property, determining where different types of residential property are located, and evaluating how Parkville's residential property has changed in the past 20 years. </p>
          <p class="lead">The Importance of Mapping</p>
          <p> Maps are useful to people in a variety of professions for several reasons. They help us visualize data with a spatial component, and in doing so enables planners and community developers to do things like assess the needs of a neighborhood or city, determine optimal transportation routes, and develop other basic infrastructure. </p>
          <p> A good map is difficult to create, but should be easy to read. Maps are much more complex visualizations than charts and tables, and the more complex a visualization, the more decisions must be made. Cartographers must determine what size scale to use, how large or small symbols and lines should be, and which colors best represent the data, among many other things that go into making a map.  </p>

          <h2>How Has Parkville Changed?</h2>
          <p>The following table shows the total number of properties in the Parkville neighborhood that have changed since 2003. </p>
         <iframe src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQOhW8RDM0_podtqaIcgQ7hnZkF5k0KNargMUpAmBI1ZvlDbgclyGHNSezETOfa180oRrFHXOkZj0I2/pubhtml?gid=2024412925&amp;single=true&amp;widget=true&amp;headers=false"width="100%" height="400" scrolling="no"></iframe>
          <p>There are roughly 1000 total parcels of land in the Parkville neighborhood, and of these only 89 have changed in the past 20 years.  The most common change in Parkville was non-residential structures becoming a different type of non-residential structure. Another significant change was that 5 non-residential parcels became mixed use buildings.  The total number of living units added by this change alone is 19. However, the total number of living units in Parkville added since 2003 is only 7, because other parcel changes have reduced the number of living units.  So while the types of housing available in Parkville may be significantly different than they were 20 years ago, the total number of housing units is roughly the same. </p>

        <p>A big thank you to Professor Jack Dougherty in the Educational Studies department at Trinity College for his book Hands On Data Visualization, which was my primary reference for this study and immensely helpful.  I'd also like to thank him for meeting with me throughout the course to answer any and all of my questions. </p> 
          <p> Thank you also to Clark University Graduate Student Zoe Chatfield, who was my partner for this project. </p>
