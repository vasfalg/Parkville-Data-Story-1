          <h2>Introduction</h2>

          <p>Walking through Parkville today, you might be drawn to Parkville Market, Connecticut’s first food hall, with a variety of scents and flavors from cuisines around the world. Or you might notice Gather55, a pay-what-you-can restaurant serving up meals prepared by professional chefs.  Or maybe your attention will be caught by the Curioporium, a museum-esque store full of oddities and legends.  But what you might not know about these businesses, unless you have lived in Hartford for a while, is that all of them are less than a decade old. </p>
            <p> In the past 20 years or so, Hartford's Parkville neighborhood has seen significant change.  I sat down with Clark University Master's student Zoe Chatfield to further discuss the change that is happening in Parkville.  Her thesis is on how Hartford’s housing has shaped Parkville.  We wondered, who is behind this change? What are their intentions? To answer these questions in a meaningful way, I decided to create a data story with original visualizations that would supplement Zoe's thesis. The broad goal of this data story is to answer these questions: Where are different types of housing located in Parkville? Who influences development in Parkville? and, more importantly, What are their visions and goals for this neighborhood? Are these visions and goals being met? </p>

          <h2>Who Owns Residential Property in Parkville?</h2>
          <p>The following table shows the top residential property owners in Parkville, sorted by the total number of living units owned.  Something interesting to note from the data is that Dorothy Apartments LLC owns the most in property value and owns the second largest number of living units, but does not own the most parcels. This led me to question how the data should be sorted upon opening the table, as I grappled with what makes someone the biggest landlord.  The reason I decided to sort the table by living units, rather than by appraised value, is because several parcels have an appraised value of $0. Sorting the table by number of living units greatest to least makes this apparent on the first page of the table. Try sorting the table by the other columns (by clicking the column header) to further explore the data.</p>
         
  
         <iframe title="Top Property Owners in Parkville" aria-label="Table" id="datawrapper-chart-2aa6d" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/2aa6d/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="3140" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
</script>
          <p>Note about the data: Same names with different spellings were modified to match each other (example: Santos Joaquim Espirito and Santo Joaquim E were changed to match Santo Joaquim Espirito) so that individuals would not be treated as multiple people by the spreadsheet formulas. </p>
           <p>Because mixed use buildings are at least partially residential, the table includes all property owners who own both strictly residential buildings and mixed use buildings.  Explore the following interactive map to see where the top 10 landlords own property</p>

          <h2>How Has Parkville's Residential Property Changed?</h2>
          <p>The following table shows the total number of properties in the Parkville neighborhood that have changed since 2003. There are roughly 1000 total parcels of land in the Parkville neighborhood, and of these only 89 have changed in the past 20 years, which is equivalent to less than one percent off all parcels.  The most common change in Parkville was non-residential structures becoming a different type of non-residential structure. These non-residential changes will be discussed further below, in the section about commercial property.</p>
            <p>Another significant change was that 5 non-residential parcels became mixed use buildings.  The total number of living units added by this change alone is 19. However, the total number of living units in Parkville added since 2003 is only 7, because other parcel changes have reduced the number of living units.  So while the types of housing available in Parkville may be significantly different than they were 20 years ago, the total number of housing units has not changed much.</p>

         <h2>Methods</h2>
          <p>In order to create these visualizations, I used data from the Hartford Assessor's Office, which I was able to obtain through Zoe.  This dataset, which can be found in <a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Isz-M1LfoqIUDHmBmtT9goNXuF0LMRWq/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=114760113235497940492&rtpof=true&sd=true'>this Google sheet</a>, contained many variables that I knew I would not need for this project, so I started cleaning up the data by copying the datasets to new sheets and removing the columns I did not need.  I knew that if I made a mistake and accidentally deleted a column that I did need, I did not have to worry, because I was only modifying the copies of the data, and anything I needed from the original data I could easily find. </p>
          <p>After cleaning up the assessor's data, I downloaded a GEOJSON file of all of the land parcels in Hartford, and trimmed it to just the Parkville neighborhood using Mapshaper.  I then converted this GEOJSON file to a CSV, so that I could modify it more easily. I then used a variety of formulas to match the Parkville parcel data with the data from the assessor's office.  Conveniently, each parcel has a GIS Pin, which was also present in the Assessor's dataset, so using VLOOKUP I was able to match each parcel with the attributes I desired.</p>
